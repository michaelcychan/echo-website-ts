# Echo site

This is a small exercise that I made to experiment to create a React app using TypeScript. I also published it to GitHub page: https://michaelcychan.github.io/echo-website-ts/    

It will repeat what you say just like echo from a cave. Try a sentence more than 3 words.

## Installation and Running
```
npm install
npm run start
```

## Publishing to GitHub Page
```
npm run deploy
= OR = 
npm run deploy -- -m "A Speical Comment"
```
